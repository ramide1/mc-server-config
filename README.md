# mcserverconfig
Optimized config files for my papermc minecraft server

If you want to create a Minecraft server with this configuration follow the next steps:
-First clone this repository, if you are new or you donÂ´t know how, you can dowload as zip and extract it.
-Download a jar server file like paper or purpur then rename it to server.jar and place it on server folder.
-Start the script (if you are in windows is start.bat and start.sh for linux, but in this last case you need to change file permissions with chmod +x start.sh).

This config is based on https://github.com/YouHaveTrouble/minecraft-optimization config guide but with some changes like vanilla parity features:
-Piston duplication
-Bedrock break in survival
-Disabled per player mob spawner to allow farms
-Mobs spawners mobs with normal AI
